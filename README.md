# Predicting Recipe Popularity: Tasty Bytes Traffic Analysis

The goal of this project is to help Tasty Bytes decide which recipes to feature on their homepage. Featuring popular recipes can increase website traffic by up to 40%, which in turn drives subscriptions and revenue. We aim to build a model to predict whether a recipe will generate high traffic and recommend how to use this model for homepage curation.
